We&#039;ll first retake control of the northern camps and military installations, as those have the most strategic value. Camp Rogain, Mike-26 and Stratis Air Base must be back under our control at the end of this day.
<br/>
As Kamino did not stock any hacking tools or equipment, we&#039;ll have to destroy the communications towers to prevent the enemy from using them.

player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Situation","
Over the past few weeks, our unit has been conducting routine training exercises at the Kamino Firing Range, focusing on small-arms proficiency and tactical maneuvers. With no significant threats reported on Stratis, our other installations across the island were maintained with minimal personnel. This reduced presence, due to the perceived low threat level, has now left these installations vulnerable to unexpected assault.
<br/>

<br/>
Earlier today, we received intelligence indicating that multiple military sites across Stratis are under coordinated attack by local rebel forces. Initial reports suggest that the rebels are far better equipped and organized than previously assumed. Surveillance shows they are operating with precision, targeting key sites to disrupt our communication, logistics, and mobility.
<br/>

<br/>
Evidence gathered from recent skirmishes suggests that the rebels are not acting alone. Locals are wielding modern weapons, advanced communications gear, and tactical equipment beyond what is normally accessible on the island. This indicates support from an off-island benefactor, likely supplying both training and resources to bolster the insurgency.
<br/>

<br/>
In a further escalation, our communication towers across Stratis have been compromised, with evidence pointing to a sophisticated hacking operation. The enemy now has access to parts of our communication network, allowing them to monitor our movements and potentially disrupt our command structure. This breach significantly limits our ability to coordinate with HQ, adding urgency to our response.
<br/>

<br/>
The enemy has fortified strategic positions using their familiarity with the terrain, and their numbers, while unknown, appear sufficient to maintain a protracted occupation. Our objective now is to regain control of key locations and neutralize the rebel threat before they can establish further dominance over Stratis. Expect heavy resistance and prepare for potential reinforcements from hostile elements outside the island.
