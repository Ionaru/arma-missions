    We will strike fast, isolate pockets of resistance, and dismantle the militia's war-fighting capability in a single continuous push. By disrupting their logistics and cutting their communications through targeted hacks, we will fracture their command structure and leave their units blind and low on supplies.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    Momentum is critical: once the operation begins, we must maintain pressure before the militia can fall back, regroup, or call in support from sympathetic groups on the mainland.

    Our enemy is highly motivated and familiar with the jungle terrain. Keep an eye out at all times for surprise attacks, even from the local population.

player createDiaryRecord ["diary", ["Situation", "
    Over the past months, a coalition of hard-line tanoan militia groups has consolidated control over the southern islands of the archipelago. Under the banner of the People's Homeland Front, they've seized key infrastructure, tightened their grip on local communities, and begun staging armed raids against government forces. NAto advisors working with the tanoan government have discovered that the militia intends to escalate: they've established covert supply lines, a rudimentary but expanding ammunition-crafting industry, and a network of communications hubs allowing them to coordinate across the scattered islands with surprising speed.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    A recent flare-up—the ambush of a tanoan Coast Guard patrol south of Balavu—was the last straw. The tanoan government has formally requested NAto assistance in dismantling the militia presence in the south-west before the insurgency spreads to the main islands. Task force Pelican has been tasked to conduct a series of fast, high-impact strikes to cripple militia capabilities before they can reorganize or evacuate their command personnel.
